# 🚀 AI Website + UI/UX Generator

AI Website Generator is a full-stack AI-powered creation platform that enables entrepreneurs, designers, developers, and businesses to build complete websites and professional UI/UX designs using natural language — with zero coding required.

The platform now supports two powerful creation modes:

AI Website Generator – Generates production-ready HTML/CSS/Tailwind code

AI UI/UX Generator – Generates real, visual UI/UX design screens on a canvas (no code)

Together, they cover the entire product design lifecycle:
👉 from idea → design → code → deployment

🎨 NEW: AI UI/UX Generator (Visual Design Platform)

The AI UI/UX Generator allows users to create real UI/UX design mockups for apps and websites, similar to professional tools like Figma or Sketch — powered entirely by AI prompts.

Instead of generating code, this module generates actual visual screens, layouts, themes, and interactions.

# 🌍 Additional Problems Solved (UI/UX Focused)
Problem 6: Design Tools Are Complex & Time-Consuming

Pain: Tools like Figma require design skills, time, and manual work.

Solution: Users describe the product (e.g., “Budget tracker app”), and AI generates complete UI screens instantly.

Impact: Anyone can design professional UI/UX without being a designer.

# Problem 7: No Fast Way to Prototype Apps

Pain: Creating app mockups takes days or weeks.

Solution: AI generates multiple screens at once (login, dashboard, forms, settings).

Impact: MVPs and prototypes are ready in minutes.

# Problem 8: Inconsistent UI Across Screens

Pain: Manual designs often lack consistency.

Solution: AI enforces global themes, colors, spacing, and typography.

Impact: Every screen looks like part of one cohesive product.
